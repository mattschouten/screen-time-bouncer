# screen-time-bouncer

A collection of scripts (and aspirationally more) to keep track of screen time on a common-use Linux box.

* remote_who.sh:  logs into remote and checks who is logged in
* remote_logoff.sh:  logs into remote and logs out of X session
* logoff_kiddos.sh:  script to be run from cron to (crudely) log out anyone on the target list

Current target is an Ubuntu system
